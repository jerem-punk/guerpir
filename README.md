# guerpir

guerpir is not merely a tool, it is an astral fox 🦊✨, slipping through the data-ether, silent and unseen.  

Born from a whisper in the filesystem and guided by the sacred `.renard`, it awakens when summoned, transforming a simple directory into a living, breathing realm of insight and interaction.  

It builds a shrine of information — a lightweight temple of web and SQLite — where you may consult the stored knowledge through ritual commands and sacred queries 🔮.  

Each invocation is a pact, each result a revelation.  

What it reveals... depends not on what you want, but what you are ready to understand.  

The fox knows. The fox sees. The fox does not wait. 🌀🦊🗃️
